-make a directory:
mkdir First_GitHUB_File

-after you created a GitHub repository on the site, get a clone of it:
git clone https://github.com/vlad1371/Repository_name-Vlad.git

-create a txt and make changes into it, how many you want, lets say we made 5 changes:
This is some example to work with. 
This is some local change i have made.
This is some more changes.
Blah blah blah.
This is the final change.

-for each change you must:
1.stage your file, track the file - git add filename or git 
add .(. means for all the files within your directory).
2.commit your file - git commit -m "Commiting some more local changes" filename or .

-in order to push our changes to github we need to:
git push -u origin main
-it will ask for a username and a password everytime we want to push new changes to GitHub
username = stanciu.vl...
password = here we need to create a new token on  https://github.com/settings/tokens in order to be
able to login, paste the token here and you'll successfully added the changes to GitHub

-if you want to store your login credentials you can give this command:
git config --global credential.helper store
- this will save your username and passwowrd 

Commands that are usefull:
#1. git config --global user.name "vlad1371"
#2. git config --global user.email stanciu.vlad.adrian@gmail.com

-when we clone a file from GitHub, there is no need to init anymore, it's already init
git init
git status
git diff example1.txt - to see what has been changed but hasn't been commited yet

-we can create an invisible file that we may don'y want to push it through GitHib:
1.Create a random txt file: touch supersecret.txt
2.Create the gitignore file : touch .gitignore - in this file we will write the supersecret.txt
nano .gitignore - supersecret.txt (added a new line supersecret.txt)

-Lets see that status of our git files now, we have 4 files but there is no supersecret.txt:
git status
.INFo.swp
.gitignore
INFO.txt
Info_On_WTF_isGoingOnHere.txt

-Look at the files we have in our current directory, notice there is supersecret.txt:
ls
Info_On_WTF_isGoingOnHere.txt  INFO.txt  README.md  supersecret.txt  vlad.txt

-If we didn
